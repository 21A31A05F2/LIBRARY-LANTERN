        Fantasy books are a captivating genre of literature that transport readers to imaginative
         worlds filled with magic, mythical creatures, and epic adventures. Rooted in storytelling 
         traditions that date back to ancient myths and legends, fantasy invites readers to explore 
         the boundaries of human creativity and escapism.

        also offering profound insights into human nature and the complexities of life. For readers, 
        they serve as a doorway to boundless imagination, where the impossible becomes possible, and 
        adventure awaits at every turn of the page.

        Non-fiction is a genre of writing that presents factual and reality-based information, often aimed at educating, informing, or entertaining readers with real-world experiences, events, or knowledge. Unlike fiction, which stems from the imagination, non-fiction is grounded in truth and authenticity.<br>

        Fiction books are works of literature that are created from the imagination rather than being strictly based on real events or factual information. These stories are designed to entertain, provoke thought, and often reflect human experiences, emotions, and relationships. While they may draw inspiration from real life, the characters, settings, and events in fiction are primarily invented by the author.
